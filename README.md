New Year, Best You - Mental Health Awareness Website

This is a website designed to give a simple, beginner friendly tips on how to improve mental health. Rather than educating about symptoms of different mental health issues, I decided to make this more about self help. By creating a welcoming, calming and positive space, I aim to motivate and encourage users to adopt some simple steps to improve their mental health long term. 

This time of the year can be difficult, as it is the start of a new year. At this time, lots of people post about "new year, new me" on social media, which puts pressure on lots of people to give themselves unachievable targets, which in turn might make people feel worse. So, I will include tips that are easy and cheap to include in everyday busy life, so all users can benefit. 

As well as providing valuable information, laid out in an easy to access way, users will be given information about the importance of forming good habits. Then, they will have the opportunity to complete a form, which will email them a copy of a habit tracker. They can then use this to practice consistently applying some of these tips, in the hope of helping them transform their lives long term.
