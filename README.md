New Year, Best You - Mental Health Awareness Website

This is a website designed to give a simple, beginner friendly tips on how to improve mental health. Rather than educating about symptoms of different mental health issues, I decided to make this more about self help. By creating a welcoming, calming and positive space, I aim to motivate and encourage users to adopt some simple steps to improve their mental health long term. 

This time of the year can be difficult, as it is the start of a new year. At this time, lots of people post about "new year, new me" on social media, which puts pressure on lots of people to give themselves unachievable targets, which in turn might make people feel worse. So, I will include tips that are easy and cheap to include in everyday busy life, so all users can benefit. 

As well as providing valuable information, laid out in an easy to access way, users will be given information about the importance of forming good habits. Then, they will have the opportunity to complete a form, which will email them a copy of a habit tracker. They can then use this to practice consistently applying some of these tips, in the hope of helping them transform their lives long term.

Current features:

At the top, I included a navbar to help the user to navigate easily through the webpage. Each section has a link to the correct part of the page, and this works on all screen sizes. 

I included a hero image of a some calming scenery. As the aim of the site it to try and be supportive, this could be calming for the user and set a nice tone for the rest of the webpage. The heading font was Petit Formal Script, a calligraphy style font. As fonts like this tend to be more personable and casual, I selected this as I wanted it to the user to feel at ease and in safe hands, especially as this is a self help website. 

For the main body, I used a light blue background. Blue is supposed to be relaxing, so this was selected to evoke a sense of calm for the user. The font chosen was Quicksand, a sans serif font. This was used to embody clarity and make the main section look well put together. 

The main aspect of the webpage is 4 information cards which provide tips to improve mental health. These all have an eyecatching title, a good piece of information, an image and a more information button. The image was used to offer clarity and support the user in seeing what the help was at a glance. These images have alt attributes, making them accessible. These cards adapt on different screensizes. 

There is then a section for users to download their own copy of a habit tracker. The aim of this is to support the user, by offering a simple way of monitoring progress and improving mental health. 

Finally, there is a footer which includes links to other helpful resources. I aimed to include resources that will help all of the four tips I outlines earlier. The NHS is a general self help page with plenty of tips. FitOn is an app with free workout videos to help encourage users to exercise. Calm is an app that has meditation resources, which helps both good sleep and a digital detox. Finally, BBC Good Food has healthy receipes to encourage a healthy diet.  

Future additions:

In future, I would like to include other pages, with more information about each of the tips I included. I would also like to include even more tips, to help support people further improve their mental health. 

Additionally, I would like to include more motivational quotes on the page, to encourage users and harness a sense of empowerment. I could also a self help guide for people to download as well as the habit tracker. I could also include an emergency helpline. 

I would also like to include links to research papers, as I would like to reassure users that all of the recommendations are backed by science and actually work, rather than potentially just being some more clickbait that they can't trust. Also, I could include testimonials from others who have taken on this advice and how it has helped them.
